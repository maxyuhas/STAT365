Machine Learning and Data Mining Assignments -  S&amp;DS 365

This repository contains different assignments for my Machine Learning and Data Mining course. These assignments are a mixture of coding examples and algebraic solutions to more statistical theory questions. These assignments cover linear and logistic regression, mixture models, k-nearest neighbor classification and regression, cross validation, stochastic gradient decsent, ridge and lasso regression, bias-variance tradeoff, decision trees and random forest, gradient boosting, and topic models. Additional assignments in the future will cover neural networks, which will be completed in Python. Each assignment has its own folder containing the relative data sets and RMarkdown files (or Python).

Assignment 1 - Linear Regression, k-NN Classification <br/>
Assignment 2 - k-NN Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Cross Validation <br/>
Assignment 3 - Ridge Regression, LASSO Regression, Bias-Variance Tradeoff <br/>
Assignment 4 - Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting <br/>
Assignment 5 - Topic Modeling (coming soon)
